# Covid-19 Data Exploration and Visulaisation 

**Description:**

This project delves into a dataset containing Covid-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population data. It explores trends and relationships between these factors to gain insights into the pandemic's impact.

**Key Features:**

* Analyzes Covid-19 cases and deaths across locations.
* Calculates death percentage relative to cases.
* Estimates population infection rate based on cases.
* Identifies countries with the highest infection rates.
* Compares death counts and vaccination rates across continents.
* Tracks the cumulative number of vaccinations over time.
* Creates a view to store processed data for visualizations (optional).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * A database environment (e.g., SQL Server) with access to the Covid-19 dataset (`PortfolioProject1..CovidDeaths$` and `PortfolioProject1..CovidVaccinations$`).
2. **Running the Queries:**
    * Copy and paste the SQL queries provided in the README into your SQL query editor.
    * Execute the queries one by one to analyze the data.
3. **Visualizations (Optional):**
    * Use the created view (`#PercentPoplulationVaccinated`) or processed data to create visualizations with your preferred tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

**Data Source:**

* Briefly describe the source of the Covid-19 data (if publicly available, include a link).

**Next Steps:**

* Consider adding visualizations to enhance the analysis.
* Explore additional data transformations or analyses.
